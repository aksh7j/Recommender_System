# 🔍 Recommender System for E-Commerce Platform

A personalized recommendation engine built using the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), designed to enhance user experience on an e-commerce platform by suggesting products or content based on user behavior and preferences.

---

## 🌟 Objective

Develop a recommender system that delivers personalized content and product suggestions, improving user engagement, satisfaction, and conversion rates on an e-commerce platform.

---

## 📄 Dataset

* **Source**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
* **Description**: Includes user ratings, timestamps, and metadata for movies. While originally for movie recommendation, it is adaptable for general recommendation system research and modeling.

---

## 🔎 Short Description

The system predicts and recommends items that users are likely to interact with by analyzing previous interactions and item/user metadata. We aim to explore multiple recommendation strategies including:

* Collaborative Filtering
* Content-Based Filtering
* Hybrid Models

---

## ⚖️ Guidelines

### ✅ Algorithms to Implement

* **Collaborative Filtering**:

  * Memory-based: user-user & item-item similarities
  * Model-based: Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)

* **Content-Based Filtering**:

  * Utilize item metadata (genres, tags, etc.)
  * Profile users based on previously liked content

* **Hybrid Models**:

  * Combine collaborative and content-based approaches
  * Implement weighted or switching hybrid strategies

### ⚙️ Techniques to Use

* Matrix Factorization (SVD, SVD++)
* Cosine Similarity / Pearson Correlation
* Implicit Feedback Handling
* Regularization to avoid overfitting

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Testing

* Simulate real-time user interactions (e.g., clicks, ratings)
* Evaluate performance using:

  * **Precision\@K / Recall\@K**
  * **RMSE / MAE** (for predicted ratings)
  * **Engagement metrics** (click-through rate, session duration, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Tips for Optimization

### ❄️ Cold Start Problems

* For new users:

  * Use demographic or contextual bootstrapping
  * Ask onboarding questions to gather preferences

* For new items:

  * Use content-based filtering based on item features

### 📅 Context-Aware Recommendations

* Integrate contextual information such as:

  * **Time of day** (e.g., morning vs. night suggestions)
  * **Location** (suggest location-specific products)
  * **Device type** (mobile vs. desktop behavior)

---

## 💻 Technologies & Tools

* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise)
* Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
* Optional: Streamlit/Flask for building a recommendation dashboard

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Add reinforcement learning models for dynamic recommendation
* Include user sentiment analysis (from reviews/comments)
* Integrate with real e-commerce product databases
